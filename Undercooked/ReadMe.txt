Known Bugs:
- Click and Drag ingredients do not work on the first drag to areas

Not Bugs because not completely finished and/or not explained yet:
- Cooking certain foods (steak and steak) on the stove makes the ingredients disappear
	- this is because the player cooked something that's not a recipe, meaning the food should turn into trash food
- Certain food (onion and steak) has to go on a specific order for it to be it to be its final iteration
	- raw food --> cut food --> cooked food

Things we need to work on as of right now:
- More recipes
- Dirty and clean dishes
- Pets and health inspectors
- Hand mechanic so there isn't an infinite amount of resources
